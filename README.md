# Guess My Number
**Directions**: Write a program in which the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100.  The user tries to guess which number the computer chose.  If the user guesses correctly the user wins, if they guess incorrectly the computer displays a message to the user ‘Too High’ or ‘Too low’
