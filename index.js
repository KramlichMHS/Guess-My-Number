// Generates a random number between 1-100
// You do not need to know how it works just know that it does
var number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1);

// Start programing here
// You will not need a start function

// To print something in Node.js you will need to use console.log() and not println()
// Example print to console (delete before submitting project)
console.log(number);
